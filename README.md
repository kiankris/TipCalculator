TipCalculator is a tip calculator built with PHP
Submetted by: Kiankris Villagonzalo
Time Spent: ~8 hours

Functions:
  Users can enter a bill amounts, choose a default tip percentage or create a custom one, upon hitting submit the form will display the result.
  The radio buttons are displayed using a PHP loop.
  Input text values for subtotal and custom percentage are set to empty strings by default and changed when the user submits their own values.
  The format of the subtotal must be a postive number that allows up to 2 places past the decimal, the format of the custom tip percentage may be any non-negative number.
  If the user submits an invalid request for the subtotal, the subtotal prompt will turn red. This happens similarly for the tip percentage. If the user tries to submit nothing the subtotal text will turn red.
 
Extra feature:
  The tip calculator includes a custom tip percentage field.

# Notes
  The app was my first introduction to php, html, and css so reading/watching tutorials of both were required to get everything to work. 
  I spent most of my time learning about interleaving php and html.
